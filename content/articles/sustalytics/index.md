For this project, I was tasked with building a Shopify web app that pulls store data for processing. I also worked on the client's Webflow site and handle maintenance and any changes for the client. Currently, I'm building a solution for the client's blog allowing them to post on drupal and then automatically post to their other social media.

Even though this was mainly backend work I still had a chance to work on Drupal's front end. I've modified the Belgard theme to have a custom content page; so it matches better with the client's design. I've also made a few changes to the webform and the view that displays a list of posts, but most of the front-end work went into the custom content page and the front page. I had to make a new twig template for this which can be viewed here.
