As a developer, it's important to keep your online portfolio up-to-date and reflective of your skills and experience. For the past two years, I had been using Ghost as the platform for my portfolio, but I recently decided it was time for a change. I wanted to not only give my portfolio a fresh new look, but also take advantage of the benefits that come with using a different platform.

That's why I decided to make the switch to Gatsby. For those who may not be familiar, Gatsby is a static site generator that uses React, GraphQL, and other modern technologies to build fast and efficient websites. As someone with more experience using React, I was excited to not only improve my portfolio but also continue learning and using the framework on personal projects.

The transition from Ghost to Gatsby wasn't without its challenges, however. I had to spend some time learning the ins and outs of Gatsby and how to properly migrate my content over to the new platform. But with a little bit of trial and error, I was able to get my portfolio up and running on Gatsby.

One of the biggest benefits of using Gatsby has been the improvement in performance. My portfolio now loads much faster and has a smoother user experience overall. This is thanks to Gatsby's use of React and other technologies that make it easier to build fast and efficient websites.

In the future, I have a number of goals for my portfolio. I'd like to continue expanding my portfolio with new projects and technologies, and Gatsby's modern stack will allow me to do just that. I'm excited to see where this redesign takes me and can't wait to continue learning and improving my skills as a developer.
